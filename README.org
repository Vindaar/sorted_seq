* ~SortedSeq~ - an always sorted ~seq[T]~

A trivial ~SortedSeq[T] = distinct seq[T]~ type is provided, which
assures that the content of the sequence remains sorted upon pushing
new elements into it (and thus assures the flat physical memory remains in
the correct order). The sorting rules obey the order decided by the
type ~T~ contained.

For obvious reasons it does not provide a ~[]=~ write accessor.

Adding new elements is performed using ~push~ and a ~[]~ read accessor
is available. Otherwise a ~toSortedSeq~ helper similar to ~toSeq~ is
available and ~initSortedSeq~ allows pre-allocation via ~newSeqOfCap~
using the ~len~ argument.
